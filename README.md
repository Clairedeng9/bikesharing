# bikesharing

### 1. Overview of the statstical analysis
There is likely more traffic during the summer months, so we use CitiBike data from August to create a set of visualizations to convince investors that a bikesharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 

The lists of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders;
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week;
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

##### b. Starting locations
The hot starting locations are in the heart of Manhattan in NYC. The size of the circles and darkness of the BLUE indicate the relative number of trips started at those locations. It is apparent that the bulk of the bike trips are originating in the densely populated areas, which always have heavier traffic all the day.

The time periods for the usage of bikes are from 5pm to 7pm, and time is good for any maintainences could be from 2am to 4am.


### 3. Summary
To sum up from obove visualizations, the bikesharing program could be a sold business proposal. We can see the Citi bikes are popular and busy in NYC, especially, basing on the usage of times, when the time period hits heavy traffic period, like in the morning when people go to work and in the evening, and when they are off work bikesharing service, the bike usages reach to the peak.
Consider of gender, male indentifing customers take more rides than others. To make bike parking places safer or set alerts in the picking up areas will be the protential improvements for this business.
For more developing of analysis,:
1. To dicover the protential reasons where there are differences between genders, including criminal rates in starting and ending locations vs genders to see if any correlations;
2. Also to see the differences months with number of rides differences, we need to include weather data to see the relation between the number of rides and weather.
